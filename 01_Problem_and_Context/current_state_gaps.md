# Current State Gaps Analysis

This document outlines the gaps observed between existing HR operations and an ideal SaaS-enabled workflow model.

## Process Gaps
- Onboarding steps differed by HR executive
- Offboarding timelines were tracked manually
- No defined trigger points for workflow initiation
- No structured decision paths (if/else scenarios)

## Compliance Gaps
- Mandatory documentation not consistently tracked
- Employee acknowledgements recorded inconsistently
- Exit clearance steps lacked audit-ready traceability

## System Usage Gaps
- HRIS treated as a record storage tool, not a workflow engine
- Status changes not aligned with real process stages
- Approvals handled outside the system (emails / verbal)

## Impact
- Increased compliance risk
- Higher HR cognitive load
- Confusion for employees and managers
- Poor audit readiness

These gaps informed the design of standardized, system-aware workflows in subsequent phases.
