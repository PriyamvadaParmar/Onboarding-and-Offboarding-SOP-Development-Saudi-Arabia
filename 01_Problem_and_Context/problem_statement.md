# Problem Statement

The organization operated in a highly regulated Saudi labor environment and used a commercial HRIS platform to manage employee records, onboarding, and exits. 
Despite having system capability, onboarding and offboarding execution varied significantly across HR executives.

### Key Challenges
- No standardized onboarding or offboarding process
- Compliance steps understood but inconsistently executed
- Heavy reliance on individual HR interpretation
- High risk of missed documentation or delayed actions
- Poor employee experience during joining and exit
- HRIS features underutilized due to lack of process clarity

From a SaaS perspective, this reflected a common enablement issue:
**strong functionality without clear, executable workflows for users.**

The problem was not lack of tools, but lack of:
- Clear workflows
- Ownership clarity
- Compliance checkpoints
- Enablement-style documentation
