# Employee Lifecycle Overview

To design scalable and enablement-friendly workflows, the employee lifecycle was mapped end-to-end, similar to how HR SaaS products define user journeys.

## Lifecycle Stages

### 1. Pre-Joining
- Offer acceptance
- Contract issuance
- Initial document collection

### 2. Onboarding
- Employee record creation
- Mandatory documentation upload
- Policy acknowledgements
- First-day formalities

### 3. Active Employment
- Probation tracking
- Status updates
- Ongoing compliance documentation

### 4. Offboarding
- Resignation or termination initiation
- Notice period tracking
- Asset handover
- Access revocation
- Final settlement and documentation

## Design Principles
- Clear trigger points for each stage
- Defined ownership (HR / Manager / Employee)
- Compliance checkpoints embedded into workflows
- HRIS-aware but tool-agnostic structure

This lifecycle mapping served as the foundation for detailed onboarding and offboarding workflows.
